# Campus Mobility & Commuter Habits Study

This report presents an analysis of the Campus Mobility & Commuter Habits Study, a survey designed to understand how the university community navigates travel to and from UB North campus. With a sample size of $n = 104$ respondents, the study examines the primary modes of transportation, the prevalence of car dependency, and the specific barriers preventing the adoption of more sustainable alternatives like transit, cycling, and walking.

Key focus areas include the impact of Buffalo's winter weather on commuting choices, the adequacy of current parking infrastructure, and the specific improvements, such as shuttle reliability and safety features, that could incentivize a shift away from single-occupancy vehicle travel.

Data collected during *Spring 2026* semester among students of *CIE439* for course project.
